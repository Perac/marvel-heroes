This solution uses MVVM pattern with LiveData and RxJava. This could have also been written with Kotlin flows and coroutines, which I'm comfortable with.
It uses retrofit for fetching data on API.
For DI I chose Koin as it is easy to set up and has nice support for view models. I'm also comfortable with using Dagger/Hilt.
